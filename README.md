SCTest
======

SoundCloud Test App. This app is intended for the use by the person(s) interviewing me at Soundcloud.

Required
-----

This app uses Cocoapods to manage most of it's deps you will need to have it and make sure it's up to date by running

	pod setup
	
You will also have to have git installed and up to date, which I'm assuming you do as you hopefully have cloned this project.

Setup
-----

I've provided a shell script that will take care of making sure your Cocoapods install is up to date, install the needed Cocoapods, as well as checkout the remaning non-Cocoapod dependency, to run it just type...

	./setup.sh
	
You should be good to go now. Please feel free to open an issue or contact me directly with any problems. Thanks!
